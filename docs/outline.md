# Streaming 1024-Point Fixed-Point FFT on Artix-7: Accuracy vs Performance

## Abstract
(4â€“6 sentences: what you built, how, key results you plan to measure.)

## 1. Introduction
Why fixed-point FFT on FPGA; relevance.

## 2. Methods
Q-format; butterfly; twiddle generation; scaling; architecture sketch.

## 3. Experiments
Datasets: tones, multitone, white noise; metrics: SNR, max abs error, mean relative error.

## 4. Results
Expected figures: magnitude & phase, error histograms, error vs word-length, roofline, resources.

## 5. Discussion
Tradeoffs, limitations, future work.
